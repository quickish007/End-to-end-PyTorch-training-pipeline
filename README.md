# PyTorch Training Pipeline for Breast Cancer Detection
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a complete PyTorch pipeline for classifying breast cancer (benign vs. malignant) using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset.
# Key Features:

    Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Efficient handling, scaling, and splitting of data.

    Neural Network Model: Customizable PyTorch model for binary classification.

    Training & Validation: Structured loops with performance tracking (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

    Checkpointing: Automatically saves the best-performing model.

    Visualization: Clear visualizations of training metrics and confusion matrix.
