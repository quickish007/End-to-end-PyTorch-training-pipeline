# PyTorch Training Pipeline for Breast Cancer Detection
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a complete PyTorch pipeline for classifying breast cancer (benign vs. malignant) using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset.

# Main Steps Covered:
1: Data Loading & Cleaning: Handles dataset retrieval and removes unnecessary columns.
2: Train-Test Split & Scaling: Efficiently splits data into training and testing sets and scales the features.
3: Neural Network Implementation: Defines and trains a simple yet effective neural network model using PyTorch.
4: Model Training & Evaluation: Includes comprehensive training loops and validation steps to monitor accuracy and loss.
5: Performance Visualization: Provides visual insights into model performance through metrics and plots.
